* Introduction
** Activation
  The four Org commands ‘org-store-link’, ‘org-capture’, ‘org-agenda’, and ‘org-iswitchb’ should be accessible through global keys (i.e., anywhere in Emacs, not just in Org buffers).  Here are suggested bindings for these keys, please modify the keys to your own liking.
  (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
  (global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
  (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
  (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)

  With this setup, all files with extension ‘.org’ will be put into Org
mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look like this:
MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-
